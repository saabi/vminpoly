# 0.1.1
- Clean up repo

# 0.1.0
- After some bug fixes it finally works down to IE5.5 on the desktop and Opera Mini on mobile!!
- Also, I removed the dependency on jQuery.
- Now resizes correctly right after page load.
- Media query support!! (rudimentary, but check out the new demo!)
- Right now, media queries only apply to rules with vw,vh/vmin units. Other rules won't be applied just yet. More to come...
